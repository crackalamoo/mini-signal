# Mini Signal
A simple local messaging app in JavaScript and Python.
*Very* loosely based on the Signal protocol.

This app uses RSA encryption with CBC mode, RSA verification, Python `websockets`, and vanilla JavaScript. It isn't secure for production, but is a nice mini demonstration of some fundamental principles.
